I’m Mehmet Salih Yavuz, a Fullstack Developer with around 7 years of experience working across backend, frontend, and data engineering. My work spans building AI-powered document processing systems, interactive database design tools, and analytics platforms that balance performance, scalability, and user experience.

As an Apache Superset committer, I actively contribute to one of the leading open-source analytics platforms, focusing on performance optimizations, feature development, and modernizing the frontend stack. I’ve worked extensively with React, Ant Design, PostgreSQL, Docker, and AI/ML frameworks often integrating multiple technologies to deliver seamless solutions.

I enjoy solving complex technical problems, improving existing systems and delivering clean, maintainable code. Whether I’m optimizing SQL queries, migrating large codebases, or designing new features, I aim for solutions that are both technically sound and user-friendly.
